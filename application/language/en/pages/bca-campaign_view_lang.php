"The Estée Lauder Companies’ Breast Cancer Awareness (BCA) Campaign, launched by the late Evelyn H. Lauder, co-creator of the Pink Ribbon and founder of The Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF) in 1992, has been a leading voice for breast cancer awareness around the world over the last two decades, sparking a global movement that has helped save millions of lives. In 1992, thousands were dying from breast cancer yet it was only spoken about in whispers, so Mrs. Evelyn H. Lauder launched The BCA Campaign to raise awareness for the disease. She encouraged women everywhere to practice breast health, while working tirelessly to raise funds for the critical research needed to find a cure. Twenty-two years later, The BCA Campaign is active in more than 70 countries and has raised more than $53 million to support global research, education and medical services, with nearly $42 million funding 166 BCRF research projects worldwide in the past 20 years.";
