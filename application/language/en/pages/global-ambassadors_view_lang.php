"As we launch The Estée Lauder Companies’ 2014 Breast Cancer Awareness (BCA) Campaign, I find myself reflecting on the wisdom that I learned from my mother, Evelyn Lauder, whose vision and passion still guides our Company—and the breast cancer awareness movement—today. 

When my mother first began speaking out about breast cancer, few people were talking about it openly or publicly. She held a strong belief that knowledge is power, and felt a responsibility to speak up and share the stories of women and families whose lives were touched by the disease. I have many memories of her sharing hopeful messages with me, whether in emails highlighting promising new research, or personal stories about friends or colleagues fighting the disease. This year’s BCA Campaign honors the spirit of knowledge, sharing and taking action, which was such an important part of my mother’s life. I know she wants us all to fight just as hard as she did to make sure these stories are heard and lives are saved. 

Since my mother’s bold and courageous decision to launch The BCA Campaign, we have made so much progress. I see her vision in action each time a colleague finds strength and support through The BCA Campaign. When I hear these stories, I can’t help but think about my mother and how proud she would be to know that this effort lives on. 

Together—all of us at The Estée Lauder Companies—grow stronger each year in our effort to defeat breast cancer through education and medical research.";

"There is something extraordinarily moving and undeniably universal about the energy that fueled Evelyn Lauder’s vision to make breast cancer a thing of the past. I see it every day, everywhere I go, amongst all of the employees of The Estée Lauder Companies around the world. There is a determination, a light, a real and personal commitment that is somehow understood in every language. The experience of breast cancer, whether it happens to you personally or touches someone you love—unites us beyond all measure, and the more I see this in action, the more I feel the strength we all share when we join together. 

The 2014 theme for The Estée Lauder Companies’ Breast Cancer Awareness (BCA) Campaign is “LET’S DEFEAT BREAST CANCER. WE’RE STRONGER TOGETHER.” The BCA Campaign is a global effort that touches and unites everyone within The Estée Lauder Companies and beyond—our employees, our consumers, breast cancer researchers, our retail partners and stakeholders—all aligned for one purpose: to defeat breast cancer. 

This company, and the legacy and values it instills, serves as inspiration to me every day, and the strength I have witnessed since being a part of this global family continues to affirm my belief that defeating breast cancer will happen in our lifetime. The BCA Campaign is at the heart and soul of our Company; we care about making a difference and saving lives worldwide.";

"Few people could juggle being an actor, model, swimwear designer, farmer and mom — but for Elizabeth Hurley it’s all in a day’s work. Since signing as a spokesmodel with Estée Lauder in 1995, the timeless beauty has embraced the late Evelyn H. Lauder’s passion for helping women live longer and better lives, and everything she undertakes reflects that commitment. 

For many years Elizabeth enthusiastically toured the world with Evelyn Lauder on behalf of The Estée Lauder Companies’ Breast Cancer Awareness (BCA) Campaign, raising awareness about the importance of breast health and early detection, and raising funds for research to find a cure. In 2013, Elizabeth will be showing her strength, standing side-by-side with William P. Lauder, Executive Chairman of The Estée Lauder Companies, as they motivate women and families around the world to join together in strength to embrace wellbeing and act in a more powerful way to move us closer to a world without breast cancer. 

The breast cancer cause strikes close to home for Elizabeth as her grandmother died of the disease in 1992. Like so many women of her generation, her grandmother had been afraid to tell anyone that she had a lump. Bearing the memory of that experience, Elizabeth recognizes the strength of working together to educate women and men about the disease and doing all she can to raise funds that support life-saving breast cancer research. 

In October 2009, The Breast Cancer Research Foundation® (BCRF) saluted Elizabeth’s countless efforts with the Humanitarian Award, and today, a BCRF-funded grant at the Royal Marsden hospital in the United Kingdom is funded in her honor.

Although Elizabeth is known for her roles in more than two dozen films — most notably Austin Powers with Mike Myers, Bedazzled with Brendan Fraser and The Weight of Water with Sean Penn — when she is at home in England with her 11-year-old son, Damian, she often eschews the movie-star lifestyle to spend time on the 400-acre organic farm she owns in Gloucestershire. She is an outspoken advocate for healthy living and sells her rare breed meat to top London restaurants and local Farmer’s Markets.";
