"It was Wednesday, September 14, 2011, when I got the call from my radiologist, “we have the results and it’s cancer.” All the things I might not be around to see flashed before my eyes. Will I never see my children grow up? Will I not grow old with my husband? Will I ever see my family back in Ecuador again? I called my husband, David, right away. I was devastated. The timing was so off. I was in the middle of planning my daughter’s Bat Mitzvah while working full time and I felt incredibly overwhelmed, but David was calm and strong and went into action immediately. My beautiful, sweet husband helped me transform from victim to survivor. During this process I began to think about how incredible it is to be alive and how grateful I am that I’ll be able to see my children grow up, and grow old with my husband. I’ve also started to think about how important it is to share my story with others, especially those who may not feel comfortable asking for help. David and I became a team for each other and our children. If we can, we’d like to help others find and feel a similar strength.";

"I was at home and had just put the kids to bed when Jeanette called and told me she had cancer. It was one of those moments where your insides drop. The idea of Jeanette getting cancer wasn’t something we had entertained seriously during the time we were awaiting the results of the biopsy, despite the fact that her mother had breast cancer. I tried my best to comfort Jeanette, and then I called a good friend who is an oncologist. She told me to be calm and that this was a solvable problem that we would tackle. It’s a process: you gather information and you make decisions. Within a day, we were in full swing. We had a referral to an oncologist and an amazing surgeon in New York at Memorial Sloan Kettering in the Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center. I was able to take comfort in gathering facts and doing what needed to be done. We did everything together: every appointment, every decision, every talk with our kids, our parents and our friends

When her radiation treatment ended, we celebrated our daughter’s Bat Mitzvah, a day of pure joy. In some odd way, the cancer has brought us even closer. We did everything we needed to do, and we hope beyond hope that this is all behind us. We still have a whole life to live and lots more to celebrate. . ";
